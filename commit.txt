feat: Refactor seat and payment schema

This commit refactors the database schema to improve the seat and payment functionalities.

The following changes are included:

- The Seat entity has been updated to link directly to ClassType and Airplane, removing its dependency on FlightClass.
- The Booking entity now supports multiple payments, reflecting a one-to-many relationship.
- The Airplane and ClassType entities have been updated to include a collection of Seats.
- The FlightClass entity no longer has a direct relationship with Seat.
- Unit tests have been updated to align with the new entity structures.
- A new SeatDto and SeatProfile have been created to handle the mapping of the Seat entity.
